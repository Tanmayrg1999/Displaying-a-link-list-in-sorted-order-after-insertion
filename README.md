# Displaying-a-link-list-in-sorted-order-after-insertion
A singly List is the one which has two fields in its structure : one is the data fiels and the other is the poointer to the next variable. Head is the pointer that points to the first integer item of the Linked list. The last next Pointer of the link list points to the NULL. In this code I have inserted elements at the begining of the link list thus the new node points to the Head pointer.The software requirements include any c++ compiler such as devC++, codeblocks etc. Basic 1 library i.e the iostream library which is used to import some basic input and output streams.
