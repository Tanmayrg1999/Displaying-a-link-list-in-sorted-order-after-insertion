# Displaying-a-link-list-in-sorted-order-after-insertion
A singly List is the one which has two fields in its structure : one is the data fiels and the other is the poointer to the next variable. Head is the pointer that points to the first integer item of the Linked list. The last next Pointer of the link list points to the NULL. In this code I have inserted elements at the end of the link list thus the new node points to the NUll pointer and we need to traverse the entire link list and thus when we reach the NULL pointer we substitute taht address by the newnode address. Displaying a sorted link list is much more similar to that of the array. I stored the data of each node in a temporary created array i.e. arr[] and applied the bubble sort logic to sort the array. In c language we use the malloc operator but in c++ we have a new operator for dynamic memory allocation.

The software requirements include any c++ compiler such as DEV-C++, CodeBlocks etc. Basic 1 library i.e the iostream library which is used to import some basic input and output streams.
